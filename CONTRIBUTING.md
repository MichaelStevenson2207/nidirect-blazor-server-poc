# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because having some volunteers will keep this dotnet core application up to date.

Here are some important resources:

## Submitting changes

Please send a pull request with a clear list of what you've done 

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Thanks,
Michael Stevenson
